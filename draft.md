Disburse money faster with a greater impact - a new emerging slogan in the philanthropic world that started since the turn of the pandemic era. -> most possible with easy money during the low-interest and cash-flowing period?

Ms. MacKenzie Scott, who received 4% stake in the Amazon after the divorce with Jeff Bezos, handed out more money than any donors in no time (she tops 4th with $14 bn behind Warren Buffet, George Soros and Azim Premji. She did away with the beaurocratic processes such as form-filling and business-management practices put in place for 20 years. 

Putting numbers to everything (described as logframe-itis) really slowed down the process and the whole giving were made about risk-reward ratio, which undermines the value of philanthropism in our society. Also, the donor boom, which the philanthrocapitalism foresaw would come on the foundation of trustable metric-based system, was never manifested.

Philanthrocapitalism

            In America, "micro" donors, who give $100 or less, make up over 60% of the all givers, but only 3% of charitable dollars.
            Big donors, who give $50,000 or more, make up just 0.2% of all donors but they contribute over 47% by value


The share of american donors dropped from two-thirds in 2000 to half in 2018.
