## Blog #2 SCROL (Stop-Codon Read-thrOugh-Label)

FUNCAT-PLA is a proximity ligation assay, which detects the newly synthesized proteins by 1) pulsing azido amino acid into a POI, 2) clicking the azide w/ biotin-alkyne, 3) non-exclusive recognition of POI and biotin by two antibodies, 4) add nucleotide-coupled secondary antibodies to recognize the primary antibodies and 5) perform a rolling circle amplication, where these two coupled nucleotides act as primer on circular template. More detailed description can be found in an original paper.

Note: this 2015 immuno-RCA paper was in my opinion developed based on 2006 paper, which was originally developed to identify the protein-protein interaction 

In today's paper, the authors tackled the same problem from previous blog paper, "how can we detect a newly synthesized POI?", by combining the genetic code expansion and genome editing. The POI gene was edited by CRISPR-Cas9 to introduce the TAG amber codon, reporter tag and TGA opal codon at the 3' end of target gene locus in HEK293 cells. Then, the cells were transfected with orthogonal aminoacyl tRNA synthetase and cognate tRNA. In the absence of the ncAA, the POI would be released from the ribosome when it hits the TAG. In the presence of the ncAA, the amber codon would be suppressed, resulting in the read-through of the 3' tag sequence and gets released at the opal codon.

They noted that their tRNA synthetase/tRNA system only allows upto 62% suppression. This wouldn't affect the resynthesis rate of POI but the S/N ratio would be hit hard and thus sensitivity of the technology needs to be improved. The pulse-chase experiment on beta-actin (TAG)-HA shows that it can be useful for measuring both re-synthesis and degradation rates. But, again, the beta-actin is abundant, calling for its application to much scarce proteins. 

Can we develop a system where this ncAA is incorporated into the middle of target gene without affecting the innate protein when ncAA was not introduced?
