Hi, my name is Ji Sung Park. I am an organic chemist / medicinal chemist by training. 

I am interested in genome editing technologies as next-generation therapeutic modalities 

and as chemical biology tools to facilitate the discovery of traditional small molecule drugs. 

I have limited knowledge in this field, so I decided to commit to blogging 1 paper everyday

## **Blog #9 Base editor screens for in situ mutational scanning at scale - continued part 3**
*2023-08-05*

Still reading this comprehensive review on the base editor scanning and finally done.

Continuing from the last post on the limitation of using BEs for pooled screening. One big challenge is the bystander mutation which is an inevitable outcome of processivity of the base editing that covers +4 to +8 window for editing. In addition to multiple C->T/A->G mutations within the expected window, the edges of the window (+9 to +11 nt), commonly at the TA and TC motifs, can be subject to the editing. This is termed out-of-window bystander mutation. These out-of-window mutations can be more pronounced in the screening format as the rare mutations might give a fitness benefits thus enriching the sgRNA by bias. 

The prevention of the screening bias on the rare mutations can be done by transient expression of the base editor through electroporation which is known to lead to shorter half-life compared with lentiviral (would be stably expressing the protein) or mRNA/plasmid-based delivery. Alternatively, ABE9, which has ~ 2 nt editing window, should address the unwanted bystander mutations. However, when the editing window is shortened, that often leads to lower editing efficiency/limited access to desired mutation due to absence of PAM. This can potentially be address by the PAM-less Cas9 variant. This however could lead to many off-target? Another option is to use an imperfect gRNA, which will be even more imperfect after the base editing is finished. 

## **Blog #8 Base editor screens for in situ mutational scanning at scale - continued part 2**
*2023-08-04*

This review is very heavy, so I have yet to finish reading it. One section that caught my attention, maybe for next blog post, is the dual base editor. As you know the CBE and ABE both have a common limitation. As not all codons are editable, certain residues can't be edited. For example, CBE can't edit lysine and tyrosine. To bypass this issue, the simulataneous editing by the two base editors should expand the scope of editable codons. However, some of the major challenges in adopting this new dual editors in HTS is the unsynchronized editing efficiency of C->T and A -> G. Alternatively, the transversion BE could further expand ths scope but it is limited by again these residual transition editing. Two other approaches include the relaxed-PAM BE and RNA base editor containing Cas13. 

## **Blog #7 Base editor screens for in situ mutational scanning at scale - continued**
*2023-08-02*

I am still reading through this giant review paper which runs a comprehensive list of several mutational scanning approaches and compares them to the base editor scanning. The paper describes 5 ways to massively mutate a CDS of target protein to map its sequence-function landscape.

1. Base editor screen (will be covered tomorrow!)
2. CRISPR-Cas9 screens: 2/3 of the indels produced by Cas9 lead to the frameshift mutations. These mutations could lead to more deleterious outcomes for structural region of protein compared to flexible loop and thus its interpretation must be done carefully to account for possible biase in the screen readouts. Simiarly, the screen might find limited utility for screening the non-essential targets as the mutations would not affect the fitness outcomes of such targets. The advantage of this screen over base editor screening is that its large effect size might find the functional mutations in disordered proteins compared to base editor screen
3. PE screen: nCas9 (Cas9 H840A) nicks target strand, which allows the reverse-transcriptase to conjugate the nicked 5->3 strand off the RT template of the pegRNA. Its limitation in mutational screening is its variable editing efficiency and limited to small proteins possibly because its' editing window is 13 - 43 nt and pegRNA design is very challenging.
4. HDR screen (also known as saturation genome editing): similar to CRISPR-Cas9 screen + supplied with HDR template, which can introduce any mutations at the target gene. The limitation is its 100 nt window which necessitates multiple independent runs. Also, inevitably, to avoid subsequent cut by the Cas9, the template introduces a mutation in the PAM, which introduces the bystander mutations. 
5. Expression library screens : The customizable protein coding sequence is introduced as a libray. Virtually any mutation can be introduced throughout the whole protein, enabling the deep mutational scanning (DMS). However, the expression cassettes ignore the chromatin context and splicing. 

## **Blog #6 Base editor screens for in situ mutational scanning at scale**
*2023-07-31*

Disclaimer: I wanted to spend some time with my baby daughter, so took a little break.

The previous blog post was about using base editors for massively introducing the Stop codons. The base substitution at such large scale (3.4 mil sgSTOP to cover 97 - 99% of the genes) got me interested in the general overview of the base scanning tech. The general workflow of the base scanning goes like this:

<img width="1037" alt="Screenshot 2023-08-01 at 12 52 53 AM" src="https://github.com/Jisung-P91/Jisung-P91.github.io/assets/65584136/10b12116-d1bb-4e6c-91d6-b22d770eb121">

Figure adapted from Ref 1.

There are several ways to obtain the readouts on the consequences of base substitutions. One way is via directed evolution-style where the edited and fitted genes are directly sequenced. In this fashion, one would try to maximize the diversification of genetic variation. This can be achieved by using the targeted AID-mediated mutagensis and CRISPR X, which have very diffuse editing (CRISPR X has ~ 100-nt editing window).


Now in a more base editor scanning-stlye screen, one can measure the sgRNA abundance to determine if the base-subsituted gene was a loss-of-function/gain-of-function/neutral. In case the selected genes are not essential, a fluoresence reporter gene can be introduced and the function of target gene can be assessed by measuring the fluoresence output. 

<img width="769" alt="Screenshot 2023-08-01 at 1 15 28 AM" src="https://github.com/Jisung-P91/Jisung-P91.github.io/assets/65584136/9f832b14-ad8c-48c2-80c4-da6995ad1368">

Measurement of sgRNA abundance can be done at a single-cell level by single-cell RNA-seq. This approach allowed Sankaran's group to correlate the genes responsible for loss of function of transcription factor GATA1 to the erythroid differentiation as well as how the sgRNAs are represented in those different cell types after the differentiation.

## **Blog #5 CRISPR-Mediated Base Editing Enables Efficient Disruption of Eukaryotic Genes through Induction of STOP Codons**
*2023-07-28*

CRISPR-Cas9 KO screening is a versatile tool that has been extensively used in various fields. Its mechanism relies on the DSB to induce the NHEJ or HR; the former could lead to adverse cellular effects via genome rearrangment and translocation, DNA damage checkpoint activation or cell death. The homology-directed repair is much cleaner mechanism but it is low efficient. Overall, such repair mechanisms lead to non-random outcomes (1).

Non-sense mutations for tumour suppressor genes are observed in 10 - 30 % of patients suffering from hereditary cancer syndromes such as familial breast and ovarian cancer. Moreover, pre-mature stoppage in the transcript can lead to non-sense mediated mRNA decay, which can lead to affecting other normal transcripts via DNA reaarangement (2). However, the problem is that there is no tool to study this. 

The base editor can convert the 4 codons, CAA/CAG/CGA and TGG into TAA/TAG/TGA. They then created a 3.4 mil sgSTOP, which is a sgRNA library to introduce the stop codons to 97 - 99% of genes. As a proof-of-concept, they transfected the HEK293 cells with the BE3 and with/without the sgSTOP targeting four genes. Then, if the target site was successfully replaced with the stop codon, the subsequent treatment with the restriction enzyme would not recognize it and thus no digestion would be observed. This assay, called restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP), was very useful.

Next, the authors wanted to see if they can create a KO cell line using the sgSTOP. As a result, they targeted the _SMARCAL1 _ AND _ATP1A1_; the latter would render the cells resistant to the ouabain treatment if its extracellular domain was mutated in the first loop and ultimately enriched the SMARCAL1-edited cells. As shown by the RFLP, the editing efficiency was increased when ouabain was added. To isolate the SMARCAL1 KO clones, the ouabain-resistant cell was seeded at a single cell density. About 10% of the clones was homozygously edited (1).

Moreover, the authors observed 1/11 of the modified clones with indels in the SMARCAL1 locus. Although the _ATP1A1_ could accumulate the indels, the authors believed that using the base editor would lower such chance. Base editors have very low indel rate (1.1% across six loci). This is because BE has the UGI to inhibit the uracil-N-glycosylase, which would otherwise excise the uracil, leaving the abasic site by the AP lyase and leading to the indel (3). Thus, the simultaneous indel accumulation at the _ATP1A1_ loci AND SMARCAL1 would be very rare. 

Now, can we use this screening at a genome scale? The STOP codon would be introduced at the 4 possible sites, which are 13 - 17 nucleotides away from the PAM site. About 62% of all 4 codons can be converted to the stop codons, which accounts to about 500K codons. This accounts for about 99.7% of the human genes can be targeted by this screening. 

Very cool work and its feasibility for genome-level screening makes it even more attractive tool for other researchers. To me, and I think it is briefly discusse din the paper, these stop codons can be effectively turned into amber codon (others maybe opal or ochre?) for multi-site labelling. I wonder if it can be paired with the prime editors.

## **Blog #4 dual stop codon suppression in mammalian cells with genomically integrated genetic code expansion machinery**

_2023-07-26_

Ref: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.03.26.534279v1

Building on the previous PiggyBac paper, Elsässer's group further matured their chemical biology tool to incorporate two stop codons in mammalian cells stably. They remained on the use of PB system and used the PylT/PylRS ochre suppressor and TyrT/AzFRS amber suppressor pairs and GFP^102TAG150TAA reporter integrated by PB transgenesis. As you see in the adapted figure from the original pre-print, Dual encoding of the suppressor rescues the expression of the modified GFP in HCT116 cells, which are apparently tough cell lines for GCE.

To their surprise, when they tested the same dual encoding system with the intracellular proteins such as tubulin and DAXX proteins, they found poor labelling intensity from the target proteins and very noisy background. The authors attributed this to unwanted mislabelling of C-terminal amber codons

## **Blog #3 Stable expression of unnaturral proteins in mammalian cells**

_2023-07-25_

    Ref: Elsässer, S. J., Ernst, R. J., Walker, O. S. & Chin, J. W. Nat. Methods 13, 158–164 (2016).

  Assignining causation to a biological perturbation is very complex. For example, to study the complex network of PTMs on histone, it is a no brainer to manipulate the PTM-inducing enzyme and then directly correlate the biological effect to this perturbation. However, it is known that such manipulation can have pleiotropic effects - lysine acetylation is one such example. Another approach is to use Cas9 as a recruiter to a target genetic loci, which is true but it is not site-specific (for example, if you want to modify a specific site of protein). 

  Transient expression of unnatural target protein via genetic code expansion gives hetergenous mixture of the target proteins, making it not reliable for causation-determining experiments. This approach is further confounded by variable level of transfection and ncAA incorporation due to variable read-through of the amber codon. 

  Chin group presented an alternate methodology where they packaged the engineered synthetase and tRNA along with unnatural protein of interest in a PiggyBac targeting vector. They also introduced the PiggyBac transposase to cut and paste these unnatural target genes into the host DNA. Brielfy, the vector contains multiple copies of PylT to ensure high efficiency and appended dendra for fluoresence-based sorting of the cells. If the ncAA is present, the cells should give out green fluoresence from dendra. Also, they introduced resistance markers (PuroR and NeoR) to select for cells with stably incorporated genes.
