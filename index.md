Disburse money faster with a greater impact - a new emerging slogan in the philanthropic world that started since the turn of the pandemic era. -> most possible with easy money during the low-interest and cash-flowing period?

Ms. MacKenzie Scott, who received 4% stake in the Amazon after the divorce with Jeff Bezos, handed out more money than any donors in no time (she tops 4th with $14 bn behind Warren Buffet, George Soros and Azim Premji. She did away with the beaurocratic processes such as form-filling and business-management practices put in place for 20 years. 

Putting numbers to everything (described as logframe-itis) really slowed down the process and the whole giving were made about risk-reward ratio, which undermines the value of philanthropism in our society. Also, the donor boom, which the philanthrocapitalism foresaw would come on the foundation of trustable metric-based system, was never manifested.

Philanthrocapitalism

            In America, "micro" donors, who give $100 or less, make up over 60% of the all givers, but only 3% of charitable dollars.
            Big donors, who give $50,000 or more, make up just 0.2% of all donors but they contribute over 47% by value


The share of american donors dropped from two-thirds in 2000 to half in 2018.

## **Blog #6 Power Slap is the Tiktok for all combat sports** ##

A new article posted on [The Economist](https://www.economist.com/culture/2024/02/01/the-violence-of-power-slap-is-part-of-its-allure) was an interesting read. 

## **Blog #6 Trackers, not spades
*2024-02-14*

As usual, while browsing the opinions on FT, I found [this piece](https://www.ft.com/content/d5c9e07b-1278-4815-a9e9-203642a83e09) which argues that the share of national income owing to labour is declining in US mostly due to the replacement of people with machines, amongst other reasons such as globalization (workers can't move as freely as the owners) and asymmetrical growth of the big companies. Many studies indicated that the declining share of the economic pie for labour can result in the civil unrest due to elevating inequality as it affects the manufacturing workers who perform routine tasks (1 robot can eliminate 3.3 workers). So what to do? the author suggested to encourage the employers to hire humans by providing incentives to do so such as reduced payroll taxes and subsidies. She advocates that the workers should be given lower-barrier access to higher education so that their tasks are not just routine-based. 

The opinion doesn't offer much on how to stop the capitalism-driven shift from manual to automated labour. Lowering the payroll taxes and increasing the government subsidies would most likely mean to put the burden on the companies, which would eventually leave no choice but to cut more staff and implement more automation. The US manufacturing sector employed more than [13 mn Americans](https://www.ft.com/content/70d863ed-74d8-43fc-80ce-debdaa1b897f), a milestone reached since the economic meltdown in 2008 and thanks to the IRA to build the confidence in the private businesses and investors that the US gov't will support the vertically integrated US manufacturing sector. However, these factories are capable of printing out everything that was once deemed impossible without the dexterity of mankind. Labour shortages, skills gap and high interest rate are only going to bring this on the horizon sooner than later. 


## **Blog #5 AI will not help close the economic gap between wealthy and poor countries** ##
*2024-02-08*

A new opinion posted on [The Economist](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2024/01/25/the-tantalising-promise-of-ai-for-the-emerging-world) caught my attention. Just briefly, the writer argued that the advance in the artificial intelligence field will be converging the economic disparities of the global north and south. The basis of this argument was 1) the economic disruption caused by the AI, which will take away the white-collar jobs, make people lose jobs, and etc, will be of less magnitude in the global south, 2) improvement in the education and health care will strengthen the economic growth and 3) unlike the earlier technological leaps which reached some-and-now-rich countries faster and thus led to unfair start of the race to the medal, this one will be spreading everything, everywhere all at once. The chances of AI's disruption in the landscape of high-profile profession are increasing, so is the chances of automation being implemented in the supply process. [This paper](https://www.imf.org/en/Blogs/Articles/2020/12/02/blog-how-artificial-intelligence-could-widen-the-gap-between-rich-and-poor-nations) argued that the richer countries will be substituting the workers with robots, and this will cause a great divergence as it puts the downward pressure on the prices of goods. With that, the investment will most likely stay in the north and the south will still be lagging behind the subsequent advances in technologies.


## **Blog #4 News coverage** ##
*2024-01-26*

Jemima Kelly put a very nice opinion on [FT](https://www.ft.com/content/7358f177-9f93-4e51-9349-22b0c36c0c09), where she argues that the mainstream media's efforts to block Trump on its platform leads to more adverse effects on its viewers. She further argues that minimizing Trump's televised appearance contradicts the core value of journalism which isn't to protect the viewers from "untrue" news but simply to report the news. She also argues that the filtered news coverage is not in the interest of its viewers, three-quarters of whom said the journalists should provide an outlook on the whole political spectrum; quite shockingly, a significant number of journalists, especially the newly-minted ones (60% of under-30), answered that every side did not deserve an equal coverage. Lastly, Jemima argues that deflecting Trump's appearance encourages the viewers to turn to other news outlets such as other polarized news bodies or social media. 

Overall, I agree with her arguments. If we say that filtering out Trump is a result of fact-checking process, does this false news correction put the viewers on the right path towards the true things? [This study](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/20563051231179694) suggests not. They found that when the Chilean viewers were exposed to these corrections, though their mis-conceptions were effectively reduced, they've shown more mistrust in the media and perceived them as biased. This is a result of a tainted truth effect, where corrections make people start doubting other true information [ref](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11109-020-09597-3). As suggested in the paper, the level of (dis)trust in the media should be carefully gauged prior to publicly deploying the corrections (if any). Presenting the corrected news, and inevitably the existence of misinformation, to already cynical and distrusting viewers lures them away from the media

U.S. (and other parts of the globe except China) renewable energy once thrived on the back of global movement to save the planet and now faces existential problems. Key players are on the brink of falling to their knees before competitive Chinese companies. The eastern neighbor has been actively subsidizing its domestic renewable energy reform. This has led to cheap electric cars (which are half the price of the American electric cars), solar panels and wind turbines. Many of the Chinese green energy companies are looking to have toehold in the US by any means, including the invesetment in the installment of manufacturing plants in Mexico. 

In addition to reigning challengers from the East, U.S. companies face many challenges from within. First off, the U.S. has the green protectionism, which imposes tariffs on chinese imports (both final products and components) to encourage the US companies to have competitive advantage at home. However, as [FT argues](https://www.ft.com/content/de696ddb-2201-4830-848b-6301b64ad0e5), the chinese cars are so cheap that even with 25% tariff bump, the price gap is still big enough to lure the Amercian customers. No wonder how BYD exported nearly 5m vehicles in 2023 and sold 0.5 m in the fourth quarter of 2024, beating the then reignign champ, Toyota. The American companies are still struggling with supply chain issues spilling over into inflation and overall slowed demand. The American companies are further constrained by bureaucratic delays. Accroding to the [Economist](https://www.economist.com/business/2023/12/04/the-renewables-business-faces-a-make-or-break-moment), it takes 4 years to get approval to build a solar farm and 6 years to be permitted to build the on-shore wind farm. Moreover, since the most of east-to-connect cities are fully occupied, these farms are built on remote locations and you would also have to build transmission lines, which also need to be approved. Of course, the approval process is important as without it, green energy can be gained as an exchange of labour exploitation as such in Xinjiang, China. Under the new government program to increase economic prosperity in a poor region, the Chinese people with Uyghur and Kazakh background are forced into labour [source](https://cen.acs.org/energy/solar-power/US-solar-polysilicon-supply-problem/100/i33).

Moreover, the non-Chinese companies should think about positive-sum, not zero-sum. The wind turbine is a great example. The wind turbines can capture more wind and subsequently convert them into electricity more efficiently as the wings get bigger. However, as the turbine wings get bigger, the costs are rising. The bigger problem is that the newer and bigger wings are planned to debut when the proper evaluation of current models is not finished. No wonder Siemens sought a 15bn euro rescue from the Germany goverment.

## **Blog #2 American childcare system is key to maintaining the US economy on track** ##
*2024-01-02*

Happy New Year and I want to write about [this opinion](https://www.ft.com/content/1cb8cce0-89d9-4be6-8994-8fd29f3425d9). The writer reiterated Yellen's notion about the American childcare system, famously quoted as the textbook example of broken market. She argued that despite the record-high share of the female participation in the job market, the daycare centres are barely profitable, leading to multiple closures and care inflation. Many blames the lack of universal childcare system, which was executed by the former president Nixon after the World War II. Currently in the states, a parent can take a 12-week unpaid maternity leave under a generous employer, which contrasts to many developed countries such as Canada and European companies. 

Ultimately, this will threaten a tight labour market as double-income parenting would be still too costly, thanks to the end of pandemic-driven subsidies that helped keep the both parents in the job market and kept the childcare system afloat. Given that an economic penalty of losing one or two parents in the job market would cost $142 bn - $217, the write argued, the $78 bn proposal to lower the entry fee for the childcare system is a no-brainer for policymakers. Many companies have already recognized the value of providing a practical childcare support. UPS started to offer an emergency childcare services and observed the turnover rate to drop from 31% to 4% [here](https://www.ft.com/content/73ff950f-5326-4cdd-b510-72c18770fd37). On a macroeconomic scale, if the US female occupation level matched the level seen in other developed countries, the US economy would receive a $1tn boost over the next 10 years (Moody's estimate).  

A strong childcare system is a recipe for a strong and resilient economy. Parents can continue to work and build their family without jeopardizing their career goals. With the strong job market, the economy can benefit from harmonized demand and supply. However, the policymakers shouldn't apporach this issue with blindfolded distribution of subsidies. The childcare support must be handed out with targets in mind, mostly those on the low to medium-income families who currently have to allocate more than 20% of their budget to their childcare. Another solution is the provision of universal childcare as children's education rights. The UK has managed to arrive here from the income-based childcare. 

On a personal level, parents should realize that parenting is a process of becoming economist - they can't continue their pre-parenting lifestyle and spending while raising childrent. They will need to learn to juggle their finance, do a opportunity cost analysis, and if necessary, ask for help from their own parents. 

## **Blog #1 Janet Yellen's new article in WSJ!** ##
*2023-12-20*

Janet Yellen's new opinion was just published in WSJ and she's put herself in a vulnerable position for criticism which I think can be justified. A key take-away from her piece is that the inflation is heading down, real wage is up, unemployment is unprecedentedly less than 4% for many weeks and growth is sustainably strong - all thanks to Bidenomics. Maybe I take this opinion with a grain of salt and a fine-tooth comb because the presidential election is coming up in 2024 and this piece looks to me more like a propaganda. Here is my reasoning:

The CPI has been on the decline but as noted in this FT opinion (ref 1), the last mile of inflation can be very sticky. Taming the inflation down to 3.2% in US, the article noted, was a low-hanging fruit that is picked up by alleviating the external price pressures such as Ukraine-Russian war and the supply chain disruptions. The last mile can be bumpy given that the rate of wage growth is not cooling faster than the inflation. This will increase the service prices, which is one of the major driving forces in the inflation. Also, as noted in this another FT piece (ref 2), the market might be feeling deflationary pressure - Walmart observed reduced discretionary purchases although their report of overall purchasing power was still good. Although Yellen claimed that the consumer demand is still tight, we must analyse how the recent economy has impacted different income groups. BJ's Wholesale, which serves a wide range of customers, observed that while mid- and high-income customers maintained steady increase in the purchase, lower-income group showed same if not lower buying. 

The market is signalling the end of rate cuts as the inflation beast is put back in the cage and even bullying the Fed to make rate cuts. I don't believe that the inflation beast is put back in the cage yet, and until it's kept inside, which is 2%, the Fed will not make the rate cuts. There are many surprises and shocks on the horizon for the market. I suspect one of them is going to be supply chain issues such as the new Suez Canal crisis erupted by the Houthi attkcs on Red Sea shipping, which channels 20% of the world trade volumes.
