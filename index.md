Hi, my name is Ji Sung Park. I am an organic chemist / medicinal chemist by training. 

I am interested in genome editing technologies as next-generation therapeutic modalities 

and as chemical biology tools to facilitate the discovery of traditional small molecule drugs. 

I have limited knowledge in this field, so I decided to commit to blogging 1 paper everyday.
