Hi, my name is Ji Sung Park. This is a place for me to write on things that I am genuinely interested in. 

## **Blog #26 3 things that I read** ##
*2024-04-03*

1. Home depot is [betting](https://www.ft.com/content/46491f3a-2b2b-4019-886d-b3ec178864b2) big bucks on the housing market paralysis. After riding the pandemic train to spur their growth, it has lost its steam. The projected demand from retail customers is trending downward as the homeowners have tight budget for discretionary spending like home upgrades. Even if the soft landing is real and inflation comes down to 3% target, the retail demand for house repair/maintenance/upgrade will not return to the pandemic level. The old homeowners who rather sit back on its low interest rate and save rather than investing in the home renos. And as I have argued before, the housing market will be frozen at least until 2025. This is why the company is in a expansion mode into a department store for new home builds and I think that's a correct movement for a near future.

2. The Inflation Reduction Act aims to curb the inflation, including the cost of prescription drugs through price negotiation and price controls by Medicare. This has discouraged the drug makers by a big cut in the spending (estimated to be 75 bn in R&D). John LaMattina [argues](https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnlamattina/2024/03/06/early-impact-of-the-inflation-reduction-act-on-drug-discovery/?sh=5117742f51d0) that it not only gets in the way of drug development but gives no choice but to pursue biologics, more costly sister of traditional small molecule drugs. How so? well, the IRA requires that the small molecules are price-controlled after 9 years on the market as compared to 13 years for the biologics. Given that the patent lifetime is usually ~20 years and the drug becomes less profitable due to generic drugs. Not allowing the pharma companies to capitalize on the last few years of patent-backed dominance would deter the pharma companies from the small drugs. Already, Pfizer has announced its plan to shrink its small molecule proportion in the cancer drug portfolio from 94% to 35% by 2030. This is actually not going to help the drug cost because it is often more expensive to make and administer the biologicals.

3. This brings me to Mark Cuban's latest venture into healthcare industry. He founded The Mark Cuban Cost Plus Drug Co. with an ultimate goal of providing affordable access to prescription drugs. Their revolutionary, ground-breaking solution is to take out the middleman, Pharmacy-benefit manager (PBM), out of the healthcare system by open-sourcing the drug price. To be honest, I haven't fully grasped the concept of PBM. But, as this [article](https://www.wsj.com/articles/mark-cuban-discount-pharmacy-prescription-drug-prices-11670540998](https://www.wsj.com/articles/mark-cuban-discount-pharmacy-prescription-drug-prices-11670540998)) points out, some arguments that I agree are 1) the model seems to have been around for a while but Mark Cuban using his celebrity publicity powers was able to do a more effective branding and marketing and 2) so far the drugs under coverage are generic drugs, which are not where the big chunk of bill comes from. It is the brand-new prescription drugs that the patients want and 3) the current model works now because the company is lean and thus sustainable without ripping off the markup and etc. Once the company starts its own manufacturing, the operating cost will skyrocket and it is doubtful that the company can keep going. 

## **Blog #25 3 things that I read** ##
*2024-04-02*

1. Your frappuccino and caramel macchiato are just about to get [more expensvie](https://www.ft.com/content/c719e755-76f6-41ea-af8b-81256591e26e). Harsh weather condition in Vietnam and Indonesia, second- and third-biggest producers of robusta beans, would reduce the output by one-fifth, which accounts for the second consecutive year of decline. Soon, the retailers and coffee restaruants will need to pass costs onto consumers, who will blame it on the inflation, not the climate change.

2. The new law will soon keep the realtors out of jobs according to [this article](https://www.ft.com/content/cdefbf49-f48e-47fc-8008-135a9b795f0b). The new ruling lifts the seller's obligation to pay for both seller-side and buyer-side realtors and requires the buyers to pay for their own agents. This would mean that the buyers will go agent-less on their house hunting and mean a tough going for the realtors. In reality, though, it might not be a blow to the brokers who do it for the side-hustle. This new law could compound the already low demand in the housing market, further trapping the real estate in the low. The big question is whether the housing market will work without the real estate agents. In my opinion, the brokers act as market makers that work in the favour of their clients.

3. Should the rents be regulated? [This article](https://archive.is/hV60H] argues not. In the regulated-rent market, the landlord can't raise the rents without justifying at the local court and it is not cost-efficient. This leads to more landlords pulling their rents out, may even default due to lower housing values and increased refinacing cost. This would put more pressure on the local lenders like NYCB as it further squeezing the balance sheets (NYCB reported 14% of the rent-regulated loan book is at the risk of default)... In the meantime, [rent raising](https://www.wsj.com/real-estate/commercial/the-office-market-is-in-turmoil-so-why-are-rents-more-expensive-d096f961?mod=real-estate_lead_pos1) seems to be flying in the face of reason for the landlords who want to increase the housing value in this cold housing market. 

## **Blog #24 Please stop the famine** ##
*2024-03-30*

According to [this Economist article](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2024/03/27/gaza-is-on-the-brink-of-a-man-made-famine), the famine in Gaza is imminent as approx. 70% of 0.3 mn Gaza residents would experience a severe food insecurity in the next two months. What is even more disturbing is how common the malnutrition is amongst the little ones (29% of the northern Gaza children under 2 years old suffer from the malnutrition). At issue is unwillingness from both Hamas and Israeli govn't to allow in the forein aid to the Gaza residents. Their doing is justified by the Palesstinian's years of being oppressed and Israelis losing their loved by the Hamas terrorists. The war might appear to be a simple fix - releasing just over 100 Israelis. However, no one really treats the Gaza residents as hostages because they've lived in Gaza and been portrayed as Hamas supporters from the main media streams. They are just as hostages as the Israeli hostages waiting to be freed of the geopolitical/religious friction.  

## **Blog #23 Understanding the wrong bet on the Yen** ##
*2024-03-27*

As the BoJ is poised to warrant a high interest rate and make its currency more valuable. Accordingly, investors saw it as an opportunity to capitalize on - the price of yen will go up. However, [this article](https://www.ft.com/content/19d75d3e-194d-4775-a098-106f13c51ae2) explains why the yen was depreciated instead from ¥141 to ¥152. The investors' forecast overlooked the dynamic and complicated relationship in the currency pairing, in this case, yen and the dollar. During the tightening cycle, the US economy endured well with strong job market and unshakeable consumer demand. This made the Fed keep the overnight funding funds rate at 5.33%, unchanged since Apr 2023. Thus, the dollar still remained attractive and relatively made the yen less valuable. Also, the Japanese currency remained as popular funding currency for carry trades in today's exchange market. A big contributing factor is that the exchange rate still remain low volatile albeit with all the wars and geopolitcal tensions, which could hughly affect the volatility. 

## **Blog #22 Sorry, your dream home might be drifting away** ##
*2024-03-26*

The directionality of mortgage rate might not be heading downward. The mortgage rate is calculated based on a few numbers including the yield spread of the mortgage-backed securities (MBS) and 10-year Treasury yield. The investors, including the Fed, would demand a higher yield on the MBS relative to the benchmark treasury yield because it is riskier. Right now, the investors have the rights to demand a higher yield from such high mortgage rates - why? because if the rates come down (it will as the Fed signalled three cuts this year), the homeowners would want to refinance their current loans to get a lower rate and thus scrapping the fixed income for the investors. The Fed is currently trimming its balance sheets, dumping its MBS and possibly not buying any new ones (as a part of QT, mentioned in my previous Blog #12) in the near future. The banks are also not going to re-enter as big investors as their purchasing power is restrained by regulators who don't want to see the banking crisis recurring. The borrowers are still feeling the inflation and would stay happy at 3 - 4% rate, explaining the shortage of homes on sale in the current housing market. I also think that the end of negative interest rate by BoJ would encourage the Japanese investors to sell their MBS to reconsider the investment at home. This would further push up the yield of the MBS and thus widening the spread.

Ref: [WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/finance/the-new-normal-for-mortgage-rates-will-be-higher-than-many-hope-40a10162)

Revised (Mar 27, 2024) - The new rule on the broker fee could deter the buyers from entering the real estate. The buyers need to pay their own realtor fee, which used to be split from the sellers' side. This would lower the demand for the mortgages, leaving the mortgage brokers with no options but to price in more profitable margins in their rates to keep their business going. 

## **Blog #21 Bet on the yen?** ##
*2024-03-25*

BoJ has finally raised its overnight borrowing cost from sub-zero to 0.1%. This is truly the historic day for Japan's deflationary economy and foreign exchange market. The Japanese currency has served as a safe haven for asset management due to its stability, low inflation and liquidity. This new fiscal policy means that the market participants need a new strategy to diversify their portfolio and makes the carry trades less profittable. But, some like [Alaska Air](https://www.ft.com/content/f3e8923a-2c24-462a-a1ea-16264a3236e3) sees this as an opportunity to capitalize. The Fed's hawkish monetary policy has been a trip stopper for the Japanese vacation goers and impacted the Hawaiian Airlines really bad. The outcome of this deal hinges on the Fed's and BoJ's decisions on further rate cuts and hikes, respectively. The US's strong economy during this tightening cycle is a good news for the Fed - it will take its time to announce further rate cuts and recently announced the future projection to around 3% by 2026. On the other hand, it is uncertain whether the Japanese economy can withstand the rate hikes. 

## **Blog #20 More on the Biden Block and the current state of mass media** ##
*2024-03-21*

Will potecting the small yard with high fences give the Biden a win in those swing states? Frankly no. His protectionism is not original nor the one and only. His competitor, Mr. Trump, has shown how to do it - so much so that he put it on his iconic red hat, "Make America Great Again". Some believe that the deal will eventually go through during Biden's next presidency, if elected again. Even if the deal is blocked before the election, it will mean only little to his election. Such news, mostly covered in the mass media, apparently doesn't even [reach](https://www.ft.com/content/451e7466-7a91-4784-aa37-02993ff0fc9e) the voters due to lack of interest. 

## **Blog #19 Biden administration should not oppose the US Steel deal** ##
*2024-03-20*

The Biden administration is clearly playing a electoral tactic here to win more voters from the swing state. They would endorse other domestic bidders to keep their iconic company domestically owned even though the bid came in lower. On the other hand, the Japanese bidder, Nippon Steel, promised to pump huge investment, boosting the wages and benefits for the workers. But, the union of just over 20000 USS workers is still feeling bitter about the fact that they were part of the acquisition process. The union comprised largely of aged workers (30% > 40+) does not know that 1) the Japanese corporate is clueless about how the union works and thus didn't invite the union to the table and 2) it is more economically sensible for their company to receive this cash injeciton than to worry about losing their jobs due to corporate decisions by the Japanese. 

## **Blog #18 Unintended consequence of overturning the female inequality** ##
*2024-03-19*

When you want to make a fair game for everyone, something's gotta give. The gender movement has improved the female rights in many different societies. The gender pay gap is narrowing to an all-time low (although it is still 77 cents for every dollar paid to men), there are more females students on university campuses and more female leaders are taking the podium at keynote speeches. While this all looks like what it should be in aggregate, an [increasing number](https://www.ft.com/content/1decbdd1-3518-4faa-be7d-e1bc0471ad9d) thinks that we have done way so much for women equality that the men's equality is left in the shadows, or even compromised. Especially, the Gen-Z men are more inclined to feel discriminated. Some [reasoned](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2024/03/14/making-sense-of-the-gulf-between-young-men-and-women) that the female outperformance in schools, which translate to better career advances and higher expectations for mating, leaves the less-educated men resentful and angry in the far right. The gender movement is aimed at correcting the systemic prejudice and discrimination embedded in our society. There will be unavoidable tale of woes from men during this rebalacing process who have capitalized on the male-dominant society in the past decades. However, we must ensure that the young generations don't view this as biased against their own sex growing up. We must strive to ensure that there is no men's rights movement in the future.  


## **Blog #17 How are noodles different from other staple food** ##
*2024-03-15*

As the authors in this [article](https://www.ft.com/content/fa3d201e-0e0b-461b-a623-c75c7312becd) puts, the current demand for instant noodles suggest an economic red flag as this processed commodity is an index of primacy of needs over greeds. The sticky inflation and highy interest rates turned discretionary spenders to conservative ones. But, the economy overall looks very resilient. The job data looks strong, QT roll-out did not lead to disastrous bond market and consumer spending is still marchig foward. But my question is, what is so special about the noodles? why didn't other food commodities behave like the noodles? 

## **Blog #16 More Ivy schools are reinstating the standardized test requirements** ##
*2024-03-13*

Should the Ivy schools bring back the golden oldies but goodies? This [article](https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-sats-comeback-is-good-news-for-minority-students-standardized-tests-bbdbe61e) claims that it is a good news for the minority students. In contrary to the popular belief, the standardized tests, which became optional admission requirements during the pandemic, are biased against the students of the affluent background. As these tests serve as indicators of academic success in college, the studies found that the tests underpredicted the performance of wealthy students. It is important, though, to consider that the low-income students struggle financially and socially at these Ivy schools, contributing to their higher drop-out rates. It is unclear how the studies measured the academic performance and what factors were considered to normalize. The author also claims that the tests do not steepen the social ladder but only to reveal that the ladder exists due to economic disparities affecting the early child education. Unknowingly, the author is admitting that the test is biased towards those who are better prepped for the test through their upbringing or prep schools. Students who can afford to go to prep schools will ace the test and this disparity is seen even amongst the low-income students. The so-called doubly disadvantaged students (low-income and don't have scholarship to go to the prep school) have zero-shots at the Ivy schools and will not know anything about upwards mobility. In my opinion, to have or not to have this test reinstated at the Ivy schools is not so important. Low-income students still see no light at the end of their tunnel unless there is a perpetual social reform to provide better education to these low-income students in low-income neighborhood, improve their healthcare and public safety so that they can focus on their education from primary school through the college years. If the schools want to reinstate the tests to increase the chance of unbiasing their selection of applicants (though it seems like they are now biasing against the affluent), they must educate their students so that they change the society such that the tests are no longer required to make it a good news for the low-income students. 

## **Blog #15 My response to the Economist article, "how to fix the Ivy league"** ##
*2024-03-10*

An [article](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2024/03/07/how-to-fix-the-ivy-league) came up and summarized the fiascos of the recent months happenning at elite universities. The author suggests that the admission should consider reinstating the standardized test to make it fair for everyone, not for the offsprings of alumni or wealthy families. It also advocates trimming down the corporate boards that are supporters of the presidents who are elected by the DEI standards. Lastly, it suggests to stop policing the view of students and faculty. My response is that the standardized test is inherently flawed to give a fair chance as wealthier students tend to lead the scoreboards and it is unclear whether they are truly outstanding students or well-resourced students. It doesn't sit well with me when I read these articles that summarize the pro-genocide protests without the context of timeline. The protests were largely seen after the Israel troops started the retailiation against the Hamas in Gaza, which inevitably killed many innocent civilians. Yes, no matter what, the protest should not be calling for anti-semitism and genocide of any ethnic groups. But by omitting the order in which the events took place in a timely manner, it portrays these protests as cheerleaders of Hamas terrorists. These protesters were furious at the dying of innocent Gaza civillians. Again, I must assure you that their call for genocide cannot be forgiven. But, without knowing the root of their wrongdoing, there will be no fixing of the Ivy league. These protesters aren't unique to the Ivy league schools. They are everywhere, from your streets in the neighborhood, a city square and online reddit forums. They can't be weeded out by simply changing the leaders. As the article points out, the schools need to allow free speech and diverse views of their students and faculty in a manner which strives to listen and works towards the goal of fixing the root problem. 

## **Blog #14 it's really hard to tell what is kosher** ##
*2024-03-08*

If we think of carbox removal as an innovation, carbon credits are rewards for all the sweats and tears that paid off. Transformation in the auto industry from combustible to electric has milked this opportunity to turn profittable or reduce their price to dominate the market. Forestation is an obvious one to earn credits as it actively takes up the carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and converts it into some form of energy. Another carbon credit, avoidance credits, is given when you show that you have avoided introducing more carbons into the atmosphere, such as not cutting down the trees. The problem here is that it is hard to quantify how much carbon generation has been avoided by not taking down the trees. If you show that the land, if converted to some emission-generating factory grid, would generate a ton of emission, then maybe it should earn more credits? 

## **Blog #13 When the rubber meets the road (literally) and the stalled housing market** ##
*2024-03-05*

Electric vehicles emit zero emissions compared to gas-burning counterparts - let me be more specific, zero **exhaust** emissions. This [article](https://www.wsj.com/articles/electric-cars-emit-more-soot-california-ban-gas-powered-vehicles-521b29e3) shed more light on the unspoken and uncomfortable truth about non-exhaust emissions. As tires resist the friction during acceleration/deceleration and drifting and driving, they wear out and release toxic particulate (4 kg per annum!) into air, waterways and eventually us. This issue is particularly more serious for EVs as they are heavier than the gasoline vehicles due to heavy batteries thus creating more friction as the wheels roll. As the California's plan to ban the sale of gasoline vehicles by 2035 is on the Biden admin's table, it needs to show that the EVs don't bring these particulates much to the public, which looks like an impossible task for a foreseeable future. Some suggests that the drivers don't accelerate from the stop or hit the brakes too aggressively (in fact, the EVs are capable of regenerative braking to bring the cars to stop gradually), but why would you buy these expensive EVs only to drive gently?

In light of what we discussed in the blog #12 about the impact of QT selling the MBS, the [Unhedged article](https://www.ft.com/content/b0609880-2f07-4fc6-bacd-5ecfb922d30f) calls the current housing market, frozen spring. They observed that the house prices are moving [sideways](https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/index-family/indicators/sp-corelogic-case-shiller/sp-corelogic-case-shiller-composite/#overview) when other assets are all surging (even Bitcoins!). A big contributor to this is the sluggish supply of houses in the market (see below). This makes sense since many homeowners got a good, if not the best, mortgage rate during the pandemic for 20 years. Who wants to sell now, when you can work from home and the mortgage rate is so high?

## **Blog #12 The impact of QT under spotlight** ##
*2024-03-03*

The QT data is in [here](https://www.chicagobooth.edu/research/igm/USMPF/USMPF%20Paper). As this is the first time the QT got rolled out, many questions on how the monetary policy will impact the market remained to be answered. For one thing, the bond yield increased only modestly which was a big relief for the central bank: rate hikes gave the Fed no other option but to sell off their government bonds to aoivd furhter losses but this sell-off could further destabilize the bond market. Contrary to their fear, this was not observed. Apparently this is a good news for the Fed as it can keep shrinking its balance sheet by selling securities and bonds without causing much turbulence in the market. However, the impact of selling the mortagage-backed securities needs to be carefully monitored as it can lead to higher mortgage rates by banks who want to avoid taking on the risks of lending by selling the MBS to the govnerment. As noted [here](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/14/opinion/federal-reserve-housing-market.html), as the MBS gets unloaded, it could nudge the banks to increase the mortgage rates, which would shut down the housing market and equally driving up the rent market. 


## **Blog #11 Next year's valentine's day will celebrate without chocolates** ##
*2024-03-01*

Chocolates are everywhere under the sun from Valentine's day gift to a nutritional granola bar. However, to chocolate enthusiasts and Valentines, the sad news is that their affection for the chocolate is set to expire as the price of cocoa is surging (see the chart below). A few reasons are laid out in this [article](https://www.ft.com/content/4ea3116d-6a55-4d14-8a47-8988209dc1e5): 1) A climate change such as El Niño has cut the global crop yield by 11% from the two largest suppliers, Ivory Coast and Ghana, 2) Cocoa tree infection by bugs and fungi and 3) price fixing by the government export cartels. The coalition between Ivory Coast and Ghana, modeled on oil's OPEC, sets the price based on the average from the last season was designed to protect the cocoa farmers from the lows by introducing price premiums in the market. However, the price setting prevents the farmers from benefitting from the highs. The margins are even thinner for the farmers who need to pay more for sustaining the farms (the coalition covers the cost of pesticides and trees, but apparently these promises never materialize). The farmers are further hamstrung as their cocoa trees have aged and need to be re-planted.

## **Blog #10 CRE - worrisome damage but not a canary in the coal mine** ##
*2024-02-16*

As mentioned in my Blog #8, CRE is in a real trouble now. Refinancing at higher interest rates mean more owners defaulting in the future, and lenders who have a high exposure to the office loans are facing serious risk management issues. The [Kastle Back to Work barometer](https://www.kastle.com/safety-wellness/getting-america-back-to-work/) is currently 51.8% and I expect strong resistance from workers when summmoned back to offices. With virtual headsets coming on the horizon, the prospect of commuting and working offline seems to make no sense to me. Now back to [this Economist article](https://www.economist.com/2024/02/14/is-working-from-home-about-to-spark-a-financial-crisis). The bloodshed, the article aruges, is specific to small-to-medium commercial banks and only makes up only about $4trn, which accounts to about 6% of the total property value in America. Compare that to the financial crisis, which wiped out the residential property value by $16trn value in the present, the CRE meltdown would only cost a quarter of what we observed back in 2008. On top of that, the lenders only cover 75% of a building's value as opposed to the home payment fully insured by the bank. These factors indicate that the CRE woes are real but overblown. However, residential property valuation made a comeback as the demand recovered. I think the forecast for the commercial counterparts would not be so sunny as there will be less supply of on-site workers and less demand for such jobs. The vacant office buildings would be a sunk cost in the real estate market and whenever there is an effort to repurpose the office building, if permitted at all, the cost would be high and this time, spreads to wider participants in the market. 


## **Blog #9 Every coin has two sides** ##
*2024-02-16*

Every coin has two sides, even for a sounding social reform like closing the gender pay gap in our societies. Policymakers around the world have tackled the gender inequality in pay by making [pay more transparent](https://www.ft.com/content/b6ba59f6-0027-4574-a46d-cc93390b4737). There are many ways you can go about it. Countries like Sweden and Finland make individual's pay publicly accessible and many American employers are required to post the pay bands in their job postings. While the pay transparency ensures that the employers do away with unfair compensation, it apparently curbs the pay of male employees to close the gap. Other risks of the pay transparency include lower productivity from male employees and other employees who now know that they are getting paid less than their peers. All of these issues stemming from the pay transparency are complementary to the necessary social reform. No social reform proceeds smoothly. There are always speed bumps and detours. But we will get there. 

## **Blog #8 Commercial real estate (CRE) woes and WeWork legacy** ##
*2024-02-14*

The New York Community Bank's shares plummeted after its announcement of surprising losses from lending, cutting its dividends to cover for its damage and on top of that, Moody's downgrading it to junk status. Some argue that the NYCB's fall is not like what we saw with the regional bank crisis. By numbers, the crisis remains contained to small banks as shown in the chart below. The refinancing of the CRE loans is not due 2025: only about 17% of the loands is due in 2025 and 57% is not even due until 2026. So why worry? It's difficult to get people back in the office after enjoying the last few years of WFH lifestyle. The Kastle Back to Work barometer is at 53% now, improved from 48.5% since Jan 10, but it is the remaining 47% that will be tough to pursuade that the offices offer much more than their homes. In busy cities like New York and London, where these CRE concerns are more serious, commuting time is proportionally longer and eats away people's time for no reason. Also, people have learnt that they prefer social interactions within the private circles through direct messaging and became passive consumers of social media. This means that the workers show little interest in building offline human relationships with their colleagues. With that said, I think the co-working space, or also called flex spaces, would be something that satisfies the company's needs to get them back into office (very rarely) and workers' needs to avoid communting.

## **Blog #7 From social networks to social media** ##
*2024-02-13*

Social networks such as Facebook were built to serve as a platform for an online public square. It was irresistable not to participate because it is a human nature to find it amusing to sneak-peak at lives of their friends. Today 3 bn people are connected through the online platform, which account for abuot 60% of internet users. The current landscape of the social networks is not what Mark Zuckerberg described two decades ago. In US, ~ 30% online users would document and share their life online, down from 40% in 2020. The modern recommendation algorithm loads the posts/videos from the whole internet based on the user's interest, which I think makes the users feel insecure about posting their life as it gets compared to the whole online universe, not just your social circle. Also, the content format has shifted from words to short videos playing on an infinite queue. The users would be binge-watchig them, contributing to consumption of a quarter of waking hours. That leaves fewer hours to users to share their life. Lastly, sharing personal stuff has gotten only more difficult as the US became more divided and polarized. The users are discouraged from sharing their views and became passive consumers of the contents that the online influencers share. This might explain why the polarized online influences are sensational as they represent the voice of the quiet public.

## **Blog #6 Trackers, not spades** ##
*2024-02-12*

As usual, while browsing the opinions on FT, I found [this piece](https://www.ft.com/content/d5c9e07b-1278-4815-a9e9-203642a83e09) which argues that the share of national income owing to labour is declining in US mostly due to the replacement of people with machines, amongst other reasons such as globalization (workers can't move as freely as the owners) and asymmetrical growth of the big companies. Many studies indicated that the declining share of the economic pie for labour can result in the civil unrest due to elevating inequality as it affects the manufacturing workers who perform routine tasks (1 robot can eliminate 3.3 workers). So what to do? the author suggested to encourage the employers to hire humans by providing incentives to do so such as reduced payroll taxes and subsidies. She advocates that the workers should be given lower-barrier access to higher education so that their tasks are not just routine-based. 

The opinion doesn't offer much on how to stop the capitalism-driven shift from manual to automated labour. Lowering the payroll taxes and increasing the government subsidies would most likely mean to put the burden on the companies, which would eventually leave no choice but to cut more staff and implement more automation. The US manufacturing sector employed more than [13 mn Americans](https://www.ft.com/content/70d863ed-74d8-43fc-80ce-debdaa1b897f), a milestone reached since the economic meltdown in 2008 and thanks to the IRA to build the confidence in the private businesses and investors that the US gov't will support the vertically integrated US manufacturing sector. However, these factories are capable of printing out everything that was once deemed impossible without the dexterity of mankind. Labour shortages, skills gap and high interest rate are only going to bring this on the horizon sooner than later. 


## **Blog #5 AI will not help close the economic gap between wealthy and poor countries** ##
*2024-02-08*

A new opinion posted on [The Economist](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2024/01/25/the-tantalising-promise-of-ai-for-the-emerging-world) caught my attention. Just briefly, the writer argued that the advance in the artificial intelligence field will be converging the economic disparities of the global north and south. The basis of this argument was 1) the economic disruption caused by the AI, which will take away the white-collar jobs, make people lose jobs, and etc, will be of less magnitude in the global south, 2) improvement in the education and health care will strengthen the economic growth and 3) unlike the earlier technological leaps which reached some-and-now-rich countries faster and thus led to unfair start of the race to the medal, this one will be spreading everything, everywhere all at once. The chances of AI's disruption in the landscape of high-profile profession are increasing, so is the chances of automation being implemented in the supply process. [This paper](https://www.imf.org/en/Blogs/Articles/2020/12/02/blog-how-artificial-intelligence-could-widen-the-gap-between-rich-and-poor-nations) argued that the richer countries will be substituting the workers with robots, and this will cause a great divergence as it puts the downward pressure on the prices of goods. With that, the investment will most likely stay in the north and the south will still be lagging behind the subsequent advances in technologies.


## **Blog #4 News coverage** ##
*2024-01-26*

Jemima Kelly put a very nice opinion on [FT](https://www.ft.com/content/7358f177-9f93-4e51-9349-22b0c36c0c09), where she argues that the mainstream media's efforts to block Trump on its platform leads to more adverse effects on its viewers. She further argues that minimizing Trump's televised appearance contradicts the core value of journalism which isn't to protect the viewers from "untrue" news but simply to report the news. She also argues that the filtered news coverage is not in the interest of its viewers, three-quarters of whom said the journalists should provide an outlook on the whole political spectrum; quite shockingly, a significant number of journalists, especially the newly-minted ones (60% of under-30), answered that every side did not deserve an equal coverage. Lastly, Jemima argues that deflecting Trump's appearance encourages the viewers to turn to other news outlets such as other polarized news bodies or social media. 

Overall, I agree with her arguments. If we say that filtering out Trump is a result of fact-checking process, does this false news correction put the viewers on the right path towards the true things? [This study](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/20563051231179694) suggests not. They found that when the Chilean viewers were exposed to these corrections, though their mis-conceptions were effectively reduced, they've shown more mistrust in the media and perceived them as biased. This is a result of a tainted truth effect, where corrections make people start doubting other true information [ref](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11109-020-09597-3). As suggested in the paper, the level of (dis)trust in the media should be carefully gauged prior to publicly deploying the corrections (if any). Presenting the corrected news, and inevitably the existence of misinformation, to already cynical and distrusting viewers lures them away from the media

U.S. (and other parts of the globe except China) renewable energy once thrived on the back of global movement to save the planet and now faces existential problems. Key players are on the brink of falling to their knees before competitive Chinese companies. The eastern neighbor has been actively subsidizing its domestic renewable energy reform. This has led to cheap electric cars (which are half the price of the American electric cars), solar panels and wind turbines. Many of the Chinese green energy companies are looking to have toehold in the US by any means, including the invesetment in the installment of manufacturing plants in Mexico. 

In addition to reigning challengers from the East, U.S. companies face many challenges from within. First off, the U.S. has the green protectionism, which imposes tariffs on chinese imports (both final products and components) to encourage the US companies to have competitive advantage at home. However, as [FT argues](https://www.ft.com/content/de696ddb-2201-4830-848b-6301b64ad0e5), the chinese cars are so cheap that even with 25% tariff bump, the price gap is still big enough to lure the Amercian customers. No wonder how BYD exported nearly 5m vehicles in 2023 and sold 0.5 m in the fourth quarter of 2024, beating the then reignign champ, Toyota. The American companies are still struggling with supply chain issues spilling over into inflation and overall slowed demand. The American companies are further constrained by bureaucratic delays. Accroding to the [Economist](https://www.economist.com/business/2023/12/04/the-renewables-business-faces-a-make-or-break-moment), it takes 4 years to get approval to build a solar farm and 6 years to be permitted to build the on-shore wind farm. Moreover, since the most of east-to-connect cities are fully occupied, these farms are built on remote locations and you would also have to build transmission lines, which also need to be approved. Of course, the approval process is important as without it, green energy can be gained as an exchange of labour exploitation as such in Xinjiang, China. Under the new government program to increase economic prosperity in a poor region, the Chinese people with Uyghur and Kazakh background are forced into labour [source](https://cen.acs.org/energy/solar-power/US-solar-polysilicon-supply-problem/100/i33).

Moreover, the non-Chinese companies should think about positive-sum, not zero-sum. The wind turbine is a great example. The wind turbines can capture more wind and subsequently convert them into electricity more efficiently as the wings get bigger. However, as the turbine wings get bigger, the costs are rising. The bigger problem is that the newer and bigger wings are planned to debut when the proper evaluation of current models is not finished. No wonder Siemens sought a 15bn euro rescue from the Germany goverment.

## **Blog #2 American childcare system is key to maintaining the US economy on track** ##
*2024-01-02*

Happy New Year and I want to write about [this opinion](https://www.ft.com/content/1cb8cce0-89d9-4be6-8994-8fd29f3425d9). The writer reiterated Yellen's notion about the American childcare system, famously quoted as the textbook example of broken market. She argued that despite the record-high share of the female participation in the job market, the daycare centres are barely profitable, leading to multiple closures and care inflation. Many blames the lack of universal childcare system, which was executed by the former president Nixon after the World War II. Currently in the states, a parent can take a 12-week unpaid maternity leave under a generous employer, which contrasts to many developed countries such as Canada and European companies. 

Ultimately, this will threaten a tight labour market as double-income parenting would be still too costly, thanks to the end of pandemic-driven subsidies that helped keep the both parents in the job market and kept the childcare system afloat. Given that an economic penalty of losing one or two parents in the job market would cost $142 bn - $217, the write argued, the $78 bn proposal to lower the entry fee for the childcare system is a no-brainer for policymakers. Many companies have already recognized the value of providing a practical childcare support. UPS started to offer an emergency childcare services and observed the turnover rate to drop from 31% to 4% [here](https://www.ft.com/content/73ff950f-5326-4cdd-b510-72c18770fd37). On a macroeconomic scale, if the US female occupation level matched the level seen in other developed countries, the US economy would receive a $1tn boost over the next 10 years (Moody's estimate).  

A strong childcare system is a recipe for a strong and resilient economy. Parents can continue to work and build their family without jeopardizing their career goals. With the strong job market, the economy can benefit from harmonized demand and supply. However, the policymakers shouldn't apporach this issue with blindfolded distribution of subsidies. The childcare support must be handed out with targets in mind, mostly those on the low to medium-income families who currently have to allocate more than 20% of their budget to their childcare. Another solution is the provision of universal childcare as children's education rights. The UK has managed to arrive here from the income-based childcare. 

On a personal level, parents should realize that parenting is a process of becoming economist - they can't continue their pre-parenting lifestyle and spending while raising childrent. They will need to learn to juggle their finance, do a opportunity cost analysis, and if necessary, ask for help from their own parents. 

## **Blog #1 Janet Yellen's new article in WSJ!** ##
*2023-12-20*

Janet Yellen's new opinion was just published in WSJ and she's put herself in a vulnerable position for criticism which I think can be justified. A key take-away from her piece is that the inflation is heading down, real wage is up, unemployment is unprecedentedly less than 4% for many weeks and growth is sustainably strong - all thanks to Bidenomics. Maybe I take this opinion with a grain of salt and a fine-tooth comb because the presidential election is coming up in 2024 and this piece looks to me more like a propaganda. Here is my reasoning:

The CPI has been on the decline but as noted in this FT opinion (ref 1), the last mile of inflation can be very sticky. Taming the inflation down to 3.2% in US, the article noted, was a low-hanging fruit that is picked up by alleviating the external price pressures such as Ukraine-Russian war and the supply chain disruptions. The last mile can be bumpy given that the rate of wage growth is not cooling faster than the inflation. This will increase the service prices, which is one of the major driving forces in the inflation. Also, as noted in this another FT piece (ref 2), the market might be feeling deflationary pressure - Walmart observed reduced discretionary purchases although their report of overall purchasing power was still good. Although Yellen claimed that the consumer demand is still tight, we must analyse how the recent economy has impacted different income groups. BJ's Wholesale, which serves a wide range of customers, observed that while mid- and high-income customers maintained steady increase in the purchase, lower-income group showed same if not lower buying. 

The market is signalling the end of rate cuts as the inflation beast is put back in the cage and even bullying the Fed to make rate cuts. I don't believe that the inflation beast is put back in the cage yet, and until it's kept inside, which is 2%, the Fed will not make the rate cuts. There are many surprises and shocks on the horizon for the market. I suspect one of them is going to be supply chain issues such as the new Suez Canal crisis erupted by the Houthi attkcs on Red Sea shipping, which channels 20% of the world trade volumes.
